# The-Complete-LangChain-and-LLM-Guide---Own-Solutions
Own solutions to the exercises of the course "The Complete LangChain and LLM Guide"

I'm taking the coursera course "The Complete LangChain and LLM Guide" and some of the solutions seem to use code that is deprecated, so I've done my own solution. I hope that this is helpful for other sturents of the course. :)
